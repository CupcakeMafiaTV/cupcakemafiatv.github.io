CupcakeMafiaTV is a variety Twitch streamer from Canada who from a very young age has always had a passion for video games and technology which has allowed for live streaming to become an absolute perfect match for him.  While he typically leans more towards casual gaming, he will sometimes still dabble in competitive gameplay where he has reached several high ranks within those games such as obtaining Diamond 2 as a mid :Mid: laner within the game League of Legends [Season 13] and reaching an arena 3v3 rank of 2200+ as a Discipline Priest within World of Warcraft.
